Very Basic Wordle game. Similar tohttps://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

Code itself is in https://github.com/candaatalay/se01/tree/master (was pushed by my other account)


Simple Rules:

The playerâ€™s goal is to guess a secret 5-letter word within 6 attempts.

On each attempt, the player must enter 5 letters. (But it does not have to be a real word like in the original game.)

After each attempt, the player sees two hints:

Hint 1: The guessed letters that exist in the word.

Hint 2: The positions of the letters that exist in the word and are already in the correct position.

If the player types the correct word before the 7th attempt, they win. Otherwise, they lose.
